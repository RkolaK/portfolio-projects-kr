# Data Science Portfolio â€“ Kleber R.

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of my Master's program. Each project demonstrates a key concept in data science such as data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, machine learning, or real-world problem solving.
