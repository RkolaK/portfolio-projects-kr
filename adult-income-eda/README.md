# Exploratory Data Analysis of the UCI Adult Income Dataset

## Overview
This Python project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the UCI Adult Income dataset to uncover insights into how demographic attributes such as age, education, occupation, and gender relate to income levels. The project involves data loading, inspection, cleaning, and basic visualization to better understand the variables and prepare for future predictive modeling tasks.

## Objectives
- Load and inspect the Adult Income dataset
- Clean and preprocess data, including reading metadata
- Explore relationships between demographic features and income
- Visualize trends using histograms and bar plots
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning applications

## Dataset
- **Main File:** `adult_income_data.csv`
- **Metadata File:** `adult_income_names.txt`
- **Key Variables:**
  - `age`, `workclass`, `education`, `occupation`, `race`, `gender`, `income`, etc.

## Features
- Load data and metadata from external files
- Explore feature meanings and structure
- Analyze variable distributions and detect potential issues
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms for numerical features
  - Bar plots for categorical features
- Discuss relationships among key variables affecting income classification

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Ensure the dataset files (`adult_income_data.csv` and `adult_income_names.txt`) are available in the working directory.
2. Open the notebook `adult_income_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each section sequentially to view outputs and visualizations.
