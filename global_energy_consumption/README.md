# Global Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption trends across multiple countries using historical electricity usage data in terawatt-hours (TWh). It aims to identify how energy demand has changed globally, which countries have the highest or lowest consumption, and how consumption has evolved over time.

## Business Problem
Understanding how different regions consume energy can guide global energy policy and planning. With growing environmental concerns and rising energy demand, it's important to monitor which countries are driving changes in usage and identify patterns that may relate to development or policy decisions.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses raw energy consumption data
- Identifies countries with the highest and lowest consumption
- Calculates consumption growth by country
- Visualizes historical trends using line and bar charts

## How to Use
1. Run the notebook `global_energy_consumption.ipynb`.
2. Ensure the dataset `Country_Consumption_TWH.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Review output plots and insights in the notebook.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## Example Visualizations
- Top energy-consuming countries over time
- Energy consumption growth from 2000 to 2020
- Heatmaps and trendlines by country
